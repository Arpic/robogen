Bug:

Seeing the simulator die with the following error:
"Cannot find a body part with id 'myid1001' to be associated with neuron 7
Cannot decode the brain of the robot. Exiting."

Was using the following body evolution params:
numInitialParts=2:10
addBodyPart=ActiveWheg
addBodyPart=ActiveWheel
addBodyPart=FixedBrick
pNodeInsert=1.0
