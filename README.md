robogen-3DPrint
===============
Part of the Robogen Course project, LIS Laboratory, EPFL.

By Gregoire Heitz <gregoire.heitz@epfl.ch>, April 26th, 2013.

This repository contains software to produce STL files needed to 3D print parametric components like 
wheels, whegs, and parametric bricks.
The STL files will be generated according to the parameters discovered by the Evolutionary Algorithm.

This Readme file is divided into three parts:
1) Description of the structure of the folder robogen-3DPrint;
2) Installation of FreeCAD software;
3) Description of how to produce the STL files required for 3D printing the different part 
using the Replicator 2 3D Printer.

Structure of robogen-3DPrint folder

This folder contains 3 sub-folders:
- FreeCAD_Modules contains the scripts to produce the STL files for the parametric components, calling FreeCAD appropriately;
- STL_Files contains the generated STL files;
- utils contains the python scripts needed to orchestrate the production of the final STL files.

This folder also contains the following files:
- Example_finalBestInd_GP.txt is an example of what is produced by the Evolutionary Algorithm. 
- getParametricValue_LINUX.bat (which works for MAC too) and getParametricValue_WINDOWS.bat scripts to parse YOUR finalBestInd_GP.txt file.

How to install FreeCAD

- First go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/free-cad/
And Download the FreeCAD software.

It as a cross-Platform, open source software to design 2D and 3D models with an integrated python interpreter. 
We will use its capability to design each required parametric component, by simply executing the right scripts in FreeCAD.

What to do

- Copy paste YOUR finalBestInd_GP.txt file, that has been generated by the Evolutionary Algorithm, 
  in the robogen-3DPrint folder. (YOUR finalBestInd_GP.txt file has been generated in the folder where you run the Evolutionary simulator)
- Then open a terminal and go to the robogen-3DPrint folder. From there execute the batch script corresponding to your platform (getParametricValues_* batch file).
  The script will produce a Readme.txt file where you can see how many parametric components should be generated,
  and a python script for each parametric components in the FreeCAD_Modules folder.
- Open FreeCAD software. Open all Call*.py scripts, located in FreeCAD_Modules folder, and run each of them separately.
For a certain reason, the wheel is quite long to generate from FreeCAD, about 3min, so please let the software run by itself.
You should check the bottom left window "report view" to check that no errors occured.
- The scripts will export the generated STL files in the STL_Files folder.

As it is the first year of the robogen project course, it is possible that you will encounter some issues. 
I will do my best to help you solving them. Feel free to ask any question.
I hope that you will enjoy it.
