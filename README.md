The ROBOGEN simulator
=================
Andrea Maesani (andrea.maesani@epfl.ch), April 3 2013

**Read carefully ALL the document before starting doing anything!**

The simulator can be compiled on Linux, Windows and MAC OSX. 
Unfortunately, this semester the code is still  experimental, therefore we do not have any precompiled distributable to ship you. 

Hopefully, thanks to your help, we will produce a stable and robust codebase for the next semester students.

Please, use github as much as possible to report us bugs, issues and ideas for improvement.
Whenever you open a ticket for a bug, make sure your description contains:
1) Machine on which the error happened, OS version, installed libraries versions (See dependendencies later)
2) A List of instructions needed to reproduce your bug.
Also, given the premature state of the project, we will keep into consideration your effort in helping us improving the code
in the course evaluation!

Thanks to you for your help and sorry for any (many I guess, at the current stage) incovenient :-) 

## Latest updates

* Apri 30: Increased mass of obstacles to avoid strange behavior during collisions. Fixed chasing scenario light rendering.
* April 17: Improved physical simulation stability by tuning ODE parameters. Fixed ActiveHinge misalignment.
* April 16: Wheels and whegs can be evolved parametrically (the radius can change during evolution)
* April 12: The simulator now sends a bias for each evolved neuron in the neural network controller. The simulator 
  has been changed to initialize correctly the neural network.
* April 5: The light sensor has now a decent execution time, no more affecting the simulator performance.

## Contributions

Here, we will keep track of your contributions both for the final evaluation and 
for maintaining your name associated to the project.

* **Mikaz-fr** (Roy MichaÃ«l, michael.roy@epfl.ch) contributed instructions to compile the code 
 on MAC OS X and adapted part of the CMAKE code for MAC OS. 

## Git Repository

To obtain a version of the simulator code, and pull future updates you need to install
a client for GIT. Please quickly go through the GitHub help to get a grasp of how GIT works 
(https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

Note that the repository is kept private on purpose for the current semester. 
DO NOT fork it and make it publicly available. Also, although your are all given push rights,
before pushing your own modifications to the master repository it would be better to discuss them with us.
Remember **PULL is OK**, **PUSH is dangerous!!** and MUST be discussed with us.

## Requirements

You need to download and install Cmake (http://www.cmake.org/), which
will be aiding us in compiling the source code and/or automatically create a project for your favorite IDE.

Before starting to compile the ROBOGEN simulator you will need to download and 
make available to your compiler includes and library paths to:
* zLib (http://www.zlib.net/)
* libpng 1.5 (http://libpng.sourceforge.net/index.html)
* Boost (http://www.boost.org/)
* Google Protobuf (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)
* OpenSceneGraph (http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads) 
* ODE (http://sourceforge.net/projects/opende/files/) 

ODE must be compiled in double precision mode (dDOUBLE preprocessor flag)

### Linux 

On Linux we advise to install all the needed dependencies from available repositories, except for ODE 
which has to be built in double precision mode.
For example, in Ubuntu Linux 12.04 you can type

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev libpng12-0 libpng12-dev libboost1.48-all-dev libprotobuf-dev \
    protobuf-compiler libopenscenegraph-dev libopenscenegraph80

to install the required dependencies.

### Windows

To assist the compilation of ROBOGEN on Windows, we preship an archive containing all the already compiled 
dependencies (x86, 32bits, available on https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13784867/utils3.zip). 
To avoid problems, download and install Visual Studio Express 2010 (http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads).

### MAC OS X

Some help can be found on the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/amaesani/robogen-simulator/wiki/Building-robogen-simulator-on-Mac).

## Simulator build

1) Once the required dependencies are satisfied (all code compiled successfully), clone this repository
to get all the needed source code of the simulator

    git clone https://github.com/amaesani/robogen-simulator.git
    
2) Modify the paths in src/cmake/CustomPath.cmake pointing them to the correct libraries/include directories.
Note that you need to modify only those paths pointing to non-standard locations, i.e. if you installed a library under Linux
under a standard path (e.g. /usr/lib) you do not need to update the corresponding line in CustomPath.cmake

On Linux, you'll probably not modify anything on this file, except if you have the ODE library installed in non-default paths. 
In this case, you will have to modify the lines related to the ODE installation paths in CustomPath.cmake (Look for the Linux section).

On Windows, you need to download and extract the content of the precompiled libraries archive (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13784867/utils3.zip) and uncomment the fist line of CustomPath.cmake pointing it to the utils/ folder contained
in the archive. Watch out that when you extract the archive you might generate a containing folder named as the archive.
For example you might end up having a structure like:

     + utils << DO NOT use this path...
         |-- utils << ...instead CustomPath.cmake should point to this folder
         |-- run
     
3) Create an empty directory somewhere in your filesystem. We will call this directory ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR. Instead, we will
refer to the directory that contains the source code (robogen-simulator/src) as the ROBOGEN_SOURCE_DIR.
Make sure that ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR is not contained in ROBOGEN_SOURCE_DIR and viceversa.
At this point you should have something like this:

      + root directory (a directory in your filesystem)
         |-- ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR
         |-- ROBOGEN_SOURCE_DIR

Then depending on your OS the next steps might change.
On Linux, MAC OS X and Windows/MinGW, from terminal, enter ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR and run 

    cd ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ROBOGEN_SOURCE_DIR
    make -j4
    
On Windows + Visual Studio, open CMAKE GUI, enter the ROBOGEN_SOURCE_DIR in "Where to find the source" and ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR 
in "Where to build the source". Click on Configure and when done, on Generate to create a solution for Visual Studio.
The, from Visual Studio open the solution "RobogenSimulator.sln" that can be found in ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR.

### Generating projects for your IDE (Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.)

Using CMAKE you can as well generate projects for different IDEs. 
For example, to generate a project that can be imported in eclipse

    cd ROBOGEN_BUILD_DIR
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ROBOGEN_SOURCE_DIR

Please check the CMAKE manual for the correct command to generate projects for other IDEs.

## Executables

The most important executables are:
* robogen-file-viewer, a small utility to visualize the robot structures.
* robogen-simulator, the main simulator software, to be used as a server software, listen for connections from the ROBOGEN EA,
  evaluates robots and returns their fitness to the EA

You can run them, launching them from terminal with the following parameters:

    robogen-file-viewer ROBOT_FILE CONF_FILE
    
where ROBOT_FILE is the robot structure and configuration file is a file containing the ROBOGEN simulator configuration.
Once the robogen-file-viewer is open, you can pause/unpause the simulation pressing "P" on your keyboard.

    robogen-simulator PORT
    
where PORT is the port on which the server will listen for connections.
    
### Configuration file

#### Main configuration file

    scenario=racing                      # Can be racing OR chasing
    timeStep=0.01                        # Timestep [s]
    nTimeSteps=4000                      # Number of timesteps 
    terrainType=flat                     # Flat or rugged 
    terrainLength=1                      # [m]
    terrainWidth=1                       # [m]
    terrainHeight=0.5                    # [Optional] Max terrain altitude [m]
    terrainHeightField=test.gif          # [Optional] a grayscale image
    obstaclesConfigFile=obstacles.txt    # Obstacles configuration file
    startPositionConfigFile=startPos.txt # Start position configuration file
    
#### Obstacles file

    #List of obstacles positions and size, separated by a tab, an obstacle per line
    X Y X_SIZE Y_SIZE Z_SIZE

#### Start Position file

    #List of starting positions, separated by a tab.# A starting position per line
    X Y

## Running the Robogen Simulator

Once the simulator compiled succesfully, remember to copy the robogen-simulator/models/ folder into the folder from which you
will run your executable, otherwise the 3D models for the ROBOGEN robots cannot be loaded.
Check in the ROBOGEN_SOURCE_DIR/../examples/ folder for sample configuration files and 5 examples robot structure that can be visualized.

On Windows, you need to copy your executables and model folder in the run/ folder contained in the utils.zip archive
that you downloaded from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13784867/utils3.zip

## Scenario descriptions

[WARNING] As the rugged terrain loading from images is broken, you might want to use many obstacles in a scenario 
to create rugged terrains. To do that, specify the terrain as flat, and insert more obstacles in the obstacles
configuration file.

# Racing

The aim of a robot evolved under this scenario is to cover the largest distance as possible in the given amount of time.
The fitness is computed as the Euclidean distance between the center of mass of the robot at the beginning and the end of the 
simulation time.

# Chasing

A light source is created at the center of the area (0, 0, 10cm). Robots must get as close as possible to this light source,
independently from the specified starting position.
Make sure to specify starting position at a certain distance from the light source, otherwise robots might
penetrate the light source and the simulator will fail.
The fitness is computed as the sum of the distances between the center of mass of the robot and the light source over all
the simulation time.
