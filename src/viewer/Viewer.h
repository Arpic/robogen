 * \brief Class for viewing a simulation
 *
 * Viewer wraps the OpenSceneGraph code, and should be used by other classes
 * that wish to visualize a simulation.
 *
 * Previously we had separate executables for Server, ServerViewer, and
 * FileViewer.  This involved a lot of duplicate code, so this class aims to be
 * a plugin to enable visualization or not.
